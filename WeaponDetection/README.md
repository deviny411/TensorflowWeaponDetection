# Tensorflow Object Detection Walkthrough
<p>This set of Notebooks provides a complete set of code to be able to train and leverage your own custom object detection model using the Tensorflow Object Detection API. This accompanies the Tensorflow Object Detection course on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nicholasrenotte">YouTube channel</a>.

This project is inspired and based on the work of nicknochnack for the CV detection. 
I utilized the base model and made proper debugs and adjustments to allow it to fit for my project of weapon detection.
